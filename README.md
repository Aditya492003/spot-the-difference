#####  How the Game Uses `config.json`

This JSON file tells the game:
- What images to display
- Where to find the clickable differences
- What the original image size was (for accurate scaling)
- How many levels exist (if using multiple)

---

###  Sample `config.json` (Single Level)

```json
{
  "gameTitle": "Spot the Difference - Animals",
  "originalSize": {
    "width": 600, 
    "height": 571
  },
  "images": {
    "image1": "/assets/image1.jpg",
    "image2": "/assets/image2.jpg"
  },
  "differences": [
    { "x": 100, "y": 200, "width": 50, "height": 50 },
    { "x": 300, "y": 150, "width": 40, "height": 40 },
    { "x": 500, "y": 300, "width": 30, "height": 30 }
  ]
}

//I also declared the original size of image in json code so if we change the size of image in game screen then the clickable areas will areas remain on same point where we declared

```

 The app reads this file and dynamically:

. Loads the level's images
. Places invisible boxes using (x, y, width, height)
. Detects correct clicks
. Marks found differences visually
. Triggers ‚ÄúLevel Complete‚Äù state
